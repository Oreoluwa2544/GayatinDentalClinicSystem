College Thesis:
Gayatin Dental Clinic Online Reservation, Patient Profiling and Billing System.

Our college thesis was based on a Dentsitry Clinic, in Cebu Philippines. Our clients wanted a system to replace all of it's manaul processes to make their work flow much more effecient and less time consuming. So we as team composed of three people proposed a system with 3 major functionality.

Online Reservation:
-A clinic calendar where patients could select a specific time slot and date for an appointment. Patients could only select dates and schedules that are still open or available or if the clinic is not closed on that day.

-A patient may also be able to transfer or move into another time slot or date if that date and timeslot is not yet taken or closed.

-After successfully scheduling an appointment an SMS containing the conformation code is sent to the patient's email address and phone (this may only work in the philippines), the patient must have a mobile device or an email address to be able to schedule an appointment.

-After successfully conforming the appointment the selected date and timeslot will be closed, and the patient's scheduled appointment would be pending until the time he/she is served.

-The patient may also cancel his appointment.

-The clinic staff can also do all of these functionalities. With additional functions like closing and openning a date or time slot.

-There is also a reporting module which shows the clinic staffs the valuable statistics regarding their clinic patients which shows a bar graph for each selected values.

Patient Profiling 

-These functionality is only accessable to clinic staffs, these functionality allows clinic staff to create, retrieve, and track everything about the clinics patients.

-It tracks their dental records, history, every operation they have undergone in the clinic. 

-There is an image module representation of every patients teeth, each tooth is clickable you can add an operation done to that specific tooth and you can also view the different operation done to the tooth.

-Every Patient Transaction is also tracked including their billing records, their remaining balances and amounts paid.

-There is also a reporting module part of these functionality which reports statistical data regard all the transactions and patient profiles the clinic has and have.


Billing 

-This is the simplest of all the functionalities, this is just an automation of the calculation of each of the patients transactions. 

-The after payment a reciept can be printed for the clinic to issue the costumer.
